# Exoplanets Dashboard

This is a single page dashboard presenting data on the most recent (confirmed) exoplanets published by the [NASA Exoplanet Science Institue](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html).The data were selected and displayed to allow users without background in Astrophysics to easily understand and analyse it.

The dashboard was built using DC.js, D3.js and crossfilter.js libraries to present the data through different chart types : pie charts, bar/row charts, scatter plot and finally a recap table. 

The interface enables the user to collect information related to the detection of the exoplanets, the years they were discovered, and get some simple features as well as correlations regarding the planets and their hosting stellar. The user has the option to filter the exoplanets thanks to a modal form so that he/she can isolate specific planets based on chosen criteria. A recap data table is presented at the bottom of the page to provide the user with additional relevant information on individual planets in the sample (such as the hosting stellar name, distance...). 

The current deployed version can be found at [here](https://alexiadelorme.github.io/project-exoplanets/).

## UX

This dashboard is built for users who have an interest in Astrophysics and specifically exoplanets and would like to quickly analyze and collect information on the most recent and confirmed exoplanets published by the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute. 

It allows users to refine a large sample of more than 3900 via a simple modal form. They can decide what type of charts they want to display and/or filter on specific criteria to analyse data in a simple and flexible manner. After filtering on desired criteria, users can collect a set of exoplanets and extract individual features related to their exoplanets "selection".
